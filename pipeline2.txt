Aim	PBS script file name	Output name
1) FastQC testing	FastQC 	*.fastq.gz
2) Merging the reads 	read_merge 	merged_S1_R*.fastq
3) Mapping the samples to reference genome 	S1_129(jf1)_map 	S1_129(jf1).bam
4) Assemble and annotate the genome 	cufflinks_S1_129 	cufflinks_S1_129

"13) cut out unnecessary fields (1-9,11,20 needed)"	cut_seq_new 	S12_129(jf1)_F(B)_cut
14) Select only the Xchr intersects and merge 129 & jf1 one after the other for each sample 	"Xpick1(2,3)"	S12_F(B)_X_intersect
15) add total read count column to end by adding 129 & jf1 reads that were mapped ($12 and $24) 	S12_F_X_totRC 	S12_F(B)_X_totRC
16) cut out all rows that have totRC=0 	non0_reads 	S12_F(B)_X_non0

21) Join all samples into one table 	sort_join 	avg_%_table
"22) Find the difference in %jf1 expression; 12-WT, 13, 14 -mutants.. Thus add 12-13 and 12-14 jf1%"	diff_exp 	diff_express
		
23) Run HTcount to find the counts of the no. of overlaps 	HTseq 	count_S1
24) Run DESeq on the counts obtained 	DEseq 	csv.files and pdf plots
		
" ** - If encountering problems, invert the procedure. First sort in bam and then convert to bed."
